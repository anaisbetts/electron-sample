# Electron Sample.app

:no_entry_sign: this is a work in progress. It will change. Don't use it yet.

This is a sample app to work with https://github.com/atom/husk-cli

```bash
npm install # to install husk
husk bootstrap
```

Then you can run it. This will run the app in development mode.

```
husk run
```

And when you're ready to build for release run:

```
husk build
```
